# üöÄ Ready to Deploy!

The application is now ready for deployment to Render. All sensitive credentials have been removed from the codebase.

## Quick Deploy Steps:

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```
You'll need to authenticate with GitHub (use a personal access token or SSH).

### 2. Deploy on Render

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Create **TWO** services from your GitHub repo:

#### Web Service (babel-books-web)
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Plan**: Free

#### Background Worker (babel-books-worker)
- **Build Command**: `cd worker && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `cd worker && python main.py`
- **Plan**: Free

### 3. Add Environment Variables

Copy the values from `CREDENTIALS.md` to each service's environment variables in Render.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Both services need ALL the credentials!

### 4. MongoDB Setup
In MongoDB Atlas, add `0.0.0.0/0` to IP whitelist for now (restrict later for production).

## What's Working:

‚úÖ Complete story creation flow  
‚úÖ Gemini API integration for text generation  
‚úÖ Age-appropriate content generation
