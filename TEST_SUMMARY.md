## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- __tests__/path/to/test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Key Testing Patterns

1. **Mocking External Services**
   - Stripe API calls
   - MongoDB operations
   - JWT operations
   - Next.js navigation

2. **User Interaction Testing**
   - Form submissions
   - Button clicks
   - Select dropdowns
   - Authentication flows

3. **API Testing**
   - Request/response validation
   - Error handling
   - Authentication checks
   - Data validation

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Complete user flows
   - Cross-component interactions
   - Database state management
   - Subscription lifecycle

## Test Utilities Created

- `createMockRequest()` - Create mock Next.js requests
- `mockDatabase()` - Mock MongoDB operations
- `parseResponse()` - Parse API responses
- Mock implementations for Stripe, MongoDB, and jose

## Coverage Metrics

While some tests require environment-specific setup to run fully, the test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:
- Authentication flows
- Subscription management
- Story creation limits
- Replay tracking
- UI component behavior
- API endpoint validation
- Integration scenarios

The test infrastructure is ready for continuous integration and can be expanded as new features are added.
